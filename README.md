A blockchain platform with built-in UX & scalability.

# Replacing:

- privatekeys cryptography by DIDs (Decentralized IDs - so you don't need to make law-infringing cryptography worrying theoretical existing quantum computers)
- loss of privatekeys by Social Recovery
- Solidity by Solidity + Linux programming languages such as Python and Bash (code auditing needed more than ever)
- blob sharding by full sharding
- data purging by data deduplicing
- hack rekt by hack recovery through instant hardforks (same for sending assets to wrong addreses such as the "void" - "0x0...0"-equivalent - address/username)
- security by 32-token validators by DID-verified validators
- anarchy replaced by a community-governed DAO
- "gas" by "mana" naming

# Introducing:

- GLUE token, formed by 50% locked PLA and 50% locked FLOF
- Have cheaper gas and deduplication atop existing blockchains by using Silvertape's smart-contracts on them, and pay gas fees using GLUE
- Usernames instead of addresses
- IPFS CIDs as smart-contract addresses
- CoreLog/Ledger preventing duplication and validating other logs/ledgers/shards

**Note**: Silvertape have no PoC yet, and will depend on [Sharedchain](https://github.com/Plasmmer/SharedChain) (which have a PoC)
